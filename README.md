# Homebrew Tap for AFK

This is the official Homebrew tap for [AFK](https://afk-app.vercel.app) - a break reminder app for developers.

## Installation

```bash
brew tap Harry-kp/tap
brew install --cask afk
```

## First Launch

Since Afk isn't notarized through Apple's App Store, macOS will ask for permission on first launch:

1. Right-click the app → Open → Open
2. Or go to System Settings → Privacy & Security → Click "Open Anyway"

You only need to do this once.

## Updating

```bash
brew upgrade --cask afk
```

## Uninstalling

```bash
brew uninstall --cask afk
```

## About

AFK helps you take regular breaks while coding to reduce eye strain and stay focused. Lives in your menu bar and gently reminds you when it's time to step away.
